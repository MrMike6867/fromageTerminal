create 2 shortcut of fromage.exe with the ico file in this folder
one of them must be located at "C:\Users\[yourName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
and the other one on your desktop
i wanted to make an installer but it didnt work :(  

there is also a precreated user (fromageMan)
i made him bc github wont let me publish an empty folder

have a nice cheesy day :)
